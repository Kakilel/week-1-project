        <h2>Growing Up</h2>
        <p class="p1">
          I was raised in a well-mannered, responsible, and deeply religious
          family, where values such as respect, honesty, and compassion were
          instilled in me from a young age. My upbringing emphasized the
          importance of discipline, integrity, and strong moral character, which
          shaped the way I view the world and interact with others. Faith played
          a central role in our daily lives, guiding our decisions and
          strengthening our bond as a family. The principles I learned at home
          continue to influence my behavior and choices, fostering a strong
          sense of responsibility and a deep appreciation for tradition and
          spirituality.
