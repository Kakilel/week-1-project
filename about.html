      <h2>Growing Up</h2 class="heading">
      <p class="p1">
        I was raised in a well-mannered, responsible, and deeply religious
        family, where values such as respect, honesty, and compassion were
        instilled in me from a young age. My upbringing emphasized the
        importance of discipline, integrity, and strong moral character, which
        shaped the way I view the world and interact with others. Faith played
        a central role in our daily lives, guiding our decisions and
        strengthening our bond as a family. The principles I learned at home
        continue to influence my behavior and choices, fostering a strong
        sense of responsibility and a deep appreciation for tradition and
        spirituality.

      <h2>Education</h2 class="heading">
      <p class="p1">
        I pursued my education under Kenyaâ€™s 8-4-4 system, which provided a
        well-rounded academic foundation and emphasized both intellectual and
        practical skills. The system, which consists of eight years of primary
        education, four years of secondary education, helped shape my academic
        journey and personal growth. I attended Nakuru High School for my
        secondary education, an institution known for its academic excellence,
        discipline, and vibrant co-curricular programs. During my time there, I
        developed a strong work ethic, sharpened my critical thinking skills,
        and actively participated in various school activities, all of which
        contributed to my holistic development and prepared me well for future
        academic and life challenges.

      <h2>Hobbies</h2 class="heading">
      <p class="p1">
        I have a diverse range of hobbies that reflect my interests and
        passions. I enjoy reading, which allows me to explore new ideas and
        perspectives. I also love playing video games, as they provide an
        engaging way to unwind and connect with friends. Additionally, I have
        a keen interest in technology and programming, which fuels my desire
        to learn and innovate. These hobbies not only bring me joy but also
        contribute to my personal growth and development.
