      WHO IS KAKILEL
    </h1>
      <p>
        Who is Kakilel?I was born in the bustling town of Nakuru on Monday the
        4th of December 2006.Born to Kenyan parents I had no other choice but to
        grow up in a strict household which upheld good virtues and hard work.I
        therefore owe most of my succes up to this point to them for the way
        they raised me.I was always very curious;while others were being taught
        how to ride bicycles,I was trying to figure out how it worked.By the
        time I was four years old I was already thirsting for knowledge which
        was only quenched by going to nursery school,that was the year 2010.I
        faced many ups and downs,bridges were burnt,bonds were made but it was
        all a part of the process that has shaped me into what I am today.My
        biggest obstacle as most other people was transitioning into becoming a
        young adult as it brings with it it's own responsibilities.In Primary
        school I attended various schools.This is because of different factors
        such as environment and the services offered in them.Despite all this,i
        overcame and was able to attain good grades to join a National
        School.After finishing my Secondary School education at Nakuru High
        School,and doing pretty well, I had a lot of time on my hands before i
        joined University.So i decided to start my coding journey instead of
        doing pretty much nothing.Therefore i searched for one of the best
        coding bootcamps in Kenya and thats where i stumbled upon Zindua.At
        Zindua i'm guaranteed to learn and be able to gain knowledge which will
        be helpful in my future.Right now I'm only 18 years of age and have a
        lot of life ahead of me;that means new experiences and many decisions to
        be made which will shape my future and therefore more to expect,
